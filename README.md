### What is it?
An automated playlist generator, which sources music free of cost, generates a playlist and incorporates voice control. It isn't limited to music, but can get you ebooks, videos, or anything off YouTube. 

### Easy Mods
If you want to download the videos instead of just audio, edit downloader.py to get the video instead of just the audio-stream.


### Coming soon
We are working on creating a WebApp in React, but until it's complete, you will need to run Main.py to download songs, which will be saved in songs_mp3. 
*Since adding a functional microphone in React is a little tricky, this may take a minute.

### Don't worry
PyTube's cipher.py has a bug so don't worry if you get a regx match error - hold on - we're not the only ones with this problem!
This link should help us track the progress of the issue: https://github.com/pytube/pytube/issues/1678

### Until Next Time
Happy Listening:)
